Lab 3 - Assignment (DATASCI W203)

## Introduction
We are planning to see the effcet of various population factors and public policies on the normalized rate of Covid19 infections per state. The key independent variables we are interested in are:
1. Population density in the state
2. % Population at risk OR % population >= 65 years old
3. % Population living under poverty
4. The duration (in days) of shelter in place order
5. The duration (in days) of non-essential business closing

Our plan is to produce 5 linear models
